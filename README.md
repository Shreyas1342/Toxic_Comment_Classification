## Dataset
The project uses the [Toxic Comment Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) from Kaggle. This dataset consists of a large number of comments from various online platforms, labeled with different types of toxicity, such as toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/toxic-comment-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd toxic-comment-classification
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Preprocess the dataset:
   ```
   python preprocess.py
   ```
   This script performs text preprocessing tasks, such as removing special characters, tokenizing, and removing stop words.

2. Train the model:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```
   This script trains the toxic comment classification model using logistic regression and random forest algorithms on the preprocessed dataset.

3. Test the model:
   ```
   python test.py
   ```
   This script evaluates the trained model on a test set and displays the classification metrics.

## Model
The project uses logistic regression and random forest classifiers for toxic comment classification. These algorithms are commonly used for text classification tasks and have been shown to perform well in various scenarios. The models are trained using the preprocessed dataset and optimized to minimize the classification error.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using common classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide an assessment of how well the model performs in identifying different types of toxic comments.
